<h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
<center><img src="https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AI.png"></center>
<br>
Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.
<hr>
<h2>What is artificial intelligence?</h2>
In the simplest terms, AI which stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. AI manifests in a number of forms. A few examples are:

<ul>
	<li>Chatbots use AI to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient answers</li>
	<br>
	<li>Intelligent assistants use AI to parse critical information from large free-text datasets to improve scheduling</li>
	<br>
	<li>Recommendation engines can provide automated recommendations for TV shows based on users’ viewing habits</li>
</ul>
AI is much more about the process and the capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of high-functioning, human-like robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions. That makes it a very valuable business asset.

<h2>A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
Here’s a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.
<br>

<br>
<ol>
	<li><i>1956</i> - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference.</li>
	<br>
	<li><i>1969</i> - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.</li>
	<br>
	<li><i>1997</i> - Supercomputer ‘<a href="https://mashable.com/archive/kasparov-deep-blue">Deep Blue</a>’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.</li>
	<br>
	<li><i>2002</i> - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. </li>
	<br>
	<li><i>2005 - 2019</i> - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their debut.</li>
	<br>
	<li><i>2020</i> - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. </li>

<h2>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<br>
<center><img src="https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/What-Is-AI-Types-Of-Artificial-Intelligence-Edureka.png"></center>
<ul type="circle">
	<li><b>Purely Reactive</b><br><br>These machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in just one field of work. For example, in a chess game, the machine observes the moves and makes the best possible decision to win. </li><br>
	<li><b>Limited Memory</b><br><br>These machines collect previous data and continue adding it to their memory. They have enough memory or experience to make proper decisions, but memory is minimal. For example, this machine can suggest a restaurant based on the location data that has been gathered.</li><br>
	<li><b>Theory of Mind</b><br><br>This kind of AI can understand thoughts and emotions, as well as interact socially. However, a machine based on this type is yet to be built. </li><br>
	<li><b>Self-Aware</b><br><br>Self-aware machines are the future generation of these new technologies. They will be intelligent, sentient, and conscious.</li><br>

Manufacturers of these cars utilize an enormous volume of information from image recognition structures and neural networks, and AI to make autonomously driverless systems. The neural networks recognize pattern data that is nursed to the AI algorithms. The information fed includes images from interior cameras in driverless cars. The neural network then uses these images to identify the surroundings like curbs, pedestrians, street signs, traffic lights, trees, and other driving environment components.<br><br>The Waymo Google autonomous car project is an example of driverless car technology. The vehicle uses a combination of devices, lidar-light recognition, and vacillating expertise comparable to sensor and camera. It syndicates data generated by the structures to identify the surroundings and forecast what those items might do next in a fraction of seconds. The more the structure runs, the more data a system can integrate into the deep learning algorithms, making more nuanced driving adoptions. The following is how the driverless car system works; the passenger sets a destination, and the vehicles calculate the distance. The lidar device examines a 60 meters array on the car, and an active 3D map is created on the current car’s environment. The sensor is fitted on the left rear wheel and examines the drive detecting the car’s location concerning the 3D maps. Distance to the obstacle is calculated by the radar system positioned on the rear and front bumpers.<br><br>AI technology is used to power driverless cars by predicting the car’s surrounding environment for safe navigation. Technology has been on the rise in the recent past and promises to have a better future transport sector. The current autonomous vehicles have been an improvement of the previously discovered inventions like drones. This technology has got six levels of automation that range from level zero to five. The technology in driverless cars has impacted road safety, parking problems, and environmental pollutions. The major demerit of this technology is the loss of jobs and skills among many drivers. However, the technology is yet to be fully implemented to achieve fully autonomous cars, hence further research. ");}

You will rarely find 34eanything that you don’t find interesting on it. Tiktok for you page is the same; it loads up videos that relate to and the content you watch. For facebook you get ads that connect to you. Now you might wonder, how do they know what I like. Well that’s where AI comes in, it tracks and follows what you like and do and gives you personalized recommendations, collecting and most probably selling your data to other sites at the same time. Websites and apps are continuously collecting broad swaths of data on their users often without them being aware of it, or of how or where their personal information is being used or stored.<br><br>Social media has a big hand in human rights as well. For example as mentioned before people post and use their social media platforms to share news. This also violates and clashes with rights of people. It may limit their privacy and expose them, because posts do not have to be approved before it becomes available to the whole world. Privacy is only one of the many rights that are violated through the use of social media. In recent days, people post many different allegations on other people and are believed by most without any trial and proof.
